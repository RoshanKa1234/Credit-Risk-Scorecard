Credit risk scorecard development using logistic regression model

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Scorecard development process. The objective of
this project is to create a scorecard model that can be utilized to assess the initial risk associated with
granting the loan to a new customer based on their personal details, past credit history, and behavioral
data. The score generated from the model will be used to evaluate the probability of default and assess
the risk for new credit contracts
